Assignment No 2


How to run:
	
python mapmatching.py

Packages required and how to download them
Python 2.7
geopy :
 pip install geopy



Input: Kindly save input files in the folder 'Probe Data Analysis' before running the program.

Following Output files are generated by the program :
Partition6467MatchedPoints.csv   --- Has all the Map Matching data
SlopeOutput.csv                  --- Has all the slope related data

Format of SlopeOutput.csv

linkPVID, derivedSlope, surveyedSlope

		linkPVID         is a unique identifier for a link.
		derivedSlope     is the slope calculated for a probe point.
		surveyedSlope    is the slope for a specific link.



Format of Partition6467MatchedPoints.csv

sampleID, dateTime, sourceCode, latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, heading, linkPVID, direction, distFromRef, distFromLink

		sampleID	is a unique identifier for the set of probe points that were collected from a particular phone.
		dateTime	is the date and time that the probe point was collected.
		sourceCode	is a unique identifier for the data supplier (13 = Nokia).
		latitude	is the latitude in decimal degrees.
		longitude	is the longitude in decimal degrees.
		altitude	is the altitude in meters.
		speed		is the speed in KPH.
		heading		is the heading in degrees.
		linkPVID	is the published versioned identifier for the link.
		direction	is the direction the vehicle was travelling on thelink (F = from ref node, T = towards ref node).
		distFromRef	is the distance from the reference node to the map-matched probe point location on the link in decimal meters.
		distFromLink	is the perpendicular distance from the map-matched probe point location on the link to the probe point in decimal meters.

Evaluation of calculated and surveyed slope:

		This evaluation is performed in console when 'mapmatching.py' is executed.
